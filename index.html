       <h3> As an Author</h3>
     <p>Jeanine Hoffman has been writing lesbian fiction for her own enjoyment and, hopefully, the enjoyment of others since 2006. Jeanine's books always have at least a hint of romance to them as she feels that life without romance, isn't very real nor is it as much fun. We read these books to escape the harsher realities we live in, so what would a fantastical life be without romance? It's human nature to crave connection, after all. Most of all, Jeanine hopes that her readers gain as much joy from the reading of her novels as she does from writing them. (she also points out that the joy does not include editing, blurb writing, PR work, or continuity checks.)</p>  
     
     <p>In addition to showing you her current books on the market, Jeanine hopes to use this space to share with her readers some of the details of her books as they are written. Be patient with her, writing is a sometimes arduous task in the current world climate. Jeanine can be reached through email jhoffmanauthor@gmail.com</p>
